# Vision-Based Driving Assistance System

### Abstract
Driver’s inattention and distraction are the most prominent reasons for
road accidents. Since a fraction of second distraction may cause a severe accident
and hence active attention of driver is mandatory while driving a car. Intelligent
driving assistance system may reduce accident rate that are mostly occur due to
inattentiveness and in turn improve the efficiency in driving. It is quite challenging
task for computer vision to monitor the driver’s level of attention continuously and
assist him/her when level of attention is low due to distractions. This paper presents
a driving assistance system that can compute the driver’s attention and determine
his/her level of attention while driving using a simple webcam and computer vision
technique. The driver’s attention level is determined by estimating his/her face direction, gaze direction, mouth movement, and head pose from video stream captured
by the camera. If the level of attention crosses a predetermined value, the system
initiates an audio sound to create the alertness of the driver. Experimental results
show the system is functioning well and successful to generate alarms for 89.34%
cases of inattention.
